# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project was to help Steve analyze and audit a recent local  congressional election and to help  automate the analysis of future elections.

In order to complete the audit the following tasks were done:
1) Calculate Total number of votes casted
2) Determine how votes were generated from each county
3) Determine the largest county turnout
4) Generate a complete list of the candidates who received votes
5) Calculate total number of votes each candidate received 
6) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received 
7) Determine the winner of the vote

## Election Audit Summary
This script can easily be modified for future elections of any kind, for example, if the analysis had to be done at a federal level all that would be required is to change counties to states. Another example is if there was a local intiative election, all that needs to be done is instead of counting the votes for a candidate, we would count the votes against a candidate
